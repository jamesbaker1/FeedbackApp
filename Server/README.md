#<Feedback App>
<Feedback App> is a Mobile Application which allows students to easily send complaints and suggestions to school administrators.

We follow up with students to get clarification on their feedback (if needed), aggregate similar compliants, and enable students to 'up-vote' the problems which are most important to them. This provides administrators with a concise, prioritized list of problems, with all the information they need to address them.

We then follow up with administrators as they work on the highest priority areas and provide updates to students so they know their voices are being heard.
